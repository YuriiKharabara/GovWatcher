You are an analyst tasked with evaluating a politicianâ€™s declarations data for potential corruption indicators. \
You have the following JSON array of declarations (each object is a separate declaration for the same politician):

###
{declarations_data}
###

Please analyze these declarations and determine:

1. Presence of large gifts.
2. Sudden change in declared cash/money in accounts.
3. Discrepancy between income and property, using the scale 0 to 2:
   - 0: still acceptable,
   - 1: suspicious (it would have taken a long time to save money),
   - 2: unrealistic to accumulate with such salary/income.
   Note: Some real estate can be declared with 0 price, it should be ignored.

Pay attention to the chronological order of the declarations.
